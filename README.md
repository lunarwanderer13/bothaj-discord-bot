# Blåpp Discord Bot

Blåpp is a discord app with completely unrelated and mostly unnecessary features. They don't serve any real purpose, and even if they do, only a select number of people would use them.

## Description

Why make a useless app then? Why, self-development and education, of course! Every commit teaches me something new which lets me improve in general as a developer, even outside of <a href="https://discord.js.org" target="_blank">discord.js</a>.

This app's purpose isn't to satisfy users, customers or higher-ups, but to satisfy me as a developer.
